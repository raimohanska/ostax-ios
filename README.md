This is my first iOS SwiftUI app and is a client for my "Ostax" shopping list service that I use on a regular basis and which already has a fully functional web-based UI.

What I've learnt so far

- The Swift language
- SwiftUI basics
- Core Data basics
- Combine basics
- Serializing Swift enums as JSON discriminated unions
- Using Socket.IO client

Status

- Only supports adding and deleting items
- Adding and renaming lists would be nice
- Shopping mode and support for completion would be nice
- Offline support in the works
