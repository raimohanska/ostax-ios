This is my first iOS SwiftUI app and is a client for my "Ostax" shopping list service that I use on a regular basis and which already has a fully functional web-based UI.

What I've learnt so far

- The Swift language
- SwiftUI basics
- Core Data basics
- Combine basics
- Serializing Swift enums as JSON discriminated unions
- Using Socket.IO client

Required for MVP

- Completion support / shopping mode

More missing features compared to Web UI

- Edit item text
- Maybe an Edit button for deletion instead of the Trash symbol
- Add, rename, remove list
- Configure lists
- Suggestions, autocomplete
- Check for more message types not yet implemented
